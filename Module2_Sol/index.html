I'm saying sorry first. 
I'm saying sorry last.
I'm saying sorry for the future, 
but mainly for the past.
	
I'm sorry that you felt the need to apologize,
and I'm sorry that you were hurt.
I'm sorry that I can only see the good
and always try to avoid the bad.

I'm the stupid one.
I let you down, and I feel it deep within me.
	
I'm sorry for not being perfect
And for not being able to break your fears
I'm sorry for messing up
And causing all your tears
	
I'm sorry I ever doubted it
And made you second guess
I'm sorry I was so stupid
You haven't seen my best

I promise I'll be the better person U deserve and I promise I wont give up. All i ask is whether you can find it in you to forgive me and nothin changes because of this. Waiting for your answer. IM SORRY.
