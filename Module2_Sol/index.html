<span class="sec_title1">Preamble</span>
There once was a girl named divy. She was so sweet that it made people giddy. She was kind to all living things, humans and animals apart, but little did she know that this was going to break her heart.</p>

<span class="sec_title2">The story</span>
The worst for her was her friend turned wolf,
and the blood that splattered as she ran. The worst
for her: the hospital, her upper lip tugged back
to show the gash—the flesh halved deeply,
cleanly—while she was held for the needle
that rubs pain out. she submits
to the quick stitch, the thread black
against pink skin, calm now she sees
the doctor can be trusted, his voice
soothing, his face clean shaven,
the clues that signal kindness to a child.
	she’s worried, though, about her pet as she says he didnt mean it mom.</p>

This story was written by Ajay, a trusted best friend of Divy. He is awesome. He wrote this all on his own. Except the poem though, that he copied. The website, though, is his.
